This model is a simple machine learning regression project that predicts the aqueous solubility of chemical compounds based on molecular descriptors. Here's a breakdown of what it does, section by section:

Purpose of the Model
To predict the logS (logarithm of aqueous solubility) of molecules using their chemical descriptors (numerical values representing molecular properties). This is a regression task—predicting a continuous variable (logS).

Demonstrates end-to-end machine learning: data loading → preprocessing → modeling → evaluation → comparison.

Compares linear regression vs random forest regression for predicting molecular solubility.
